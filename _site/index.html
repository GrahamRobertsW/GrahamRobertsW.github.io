<h1 id="about">About</h1>

<p>An expert in machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence, particularly in incorporating ML into data anlysis workflows.</p>

<p>I have skills developing several machine learning models, ranging from extensive experience with lightweight classical models such as support vector machines and random forests to more recent developments such as active learning and reinforcement learning. <a href="cv">Click here</a> to see the full CV, and <a href="assets/files/cv.pdf">here</a> to download a print version. I completed my Ph.D. at the University of Connecticut in 2025. My specialization is in machine learning for tasks specialized to physical sciences. My first majot project was a semantic segmentation model for classifying defects in microscopy images of steel. Following that project I developed a workflow for automatic analysis of Small Angle Scattering data. This utilized a customized hierarchical decision comprised of independent trained and tuned support vector classifiers. Additionally I developed a technique for symbolic regression of implicit equations made possible with a probabilistic representation of each candidate equation.</p>

<p>My specialties are based around building efficient tools specified to the task at hand.</p>
